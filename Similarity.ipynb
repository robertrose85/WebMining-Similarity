        "While we see that there are a number of posts with greater than zero cosine similarity, it appears that there might not be a magic formula outside of maybe topic selection. Many of the \"similar\" posts are fundamentally different, despite them having very similar subject matter. Using this code, we certainly leverage the data to determine subject matter that may be of interest to the reader. For example, if the reader is looking for something like the post regarding \"Best Papers in Computer science up to 2011\" we can reasonably assume they will also like the post regarding the \"Best papers from 27 top-tier computer science conferences\"."

        "Finding similar posts in some use cases can be great, but maybe I don't have a post I like and just a topic. Let's consider maybe I need some help writing this post so I want to find good articles on \"Python web mining\". I'll start with working through TFIDF. The TF stands for Term Frequency, this is exactly as it sounds, we're looking at how often a term shows up. IDF stands for inverse document frequency, this process gives for weight to words that appear in less documents. So for example, if I didn't have stop words removed already, it would make certain words like \"The\" and \"and\" (which probably are frequently represented in each document) weigh less. Sckit makes this easy for us, see below."
